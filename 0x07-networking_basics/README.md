# Networking basics #0

This project was the first of two introducing networking concepts. In this project, I answered a few quiz-like questions and wrote a couple bash scripts while learning about the OSI model, LAN and WAN networks, and TCP/UDP data transfer protocols.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:
* **1. Types of network**
* **2. MAC and IP address**
* **3. UDP and TCP**
* **4. TCP and UDP ports**
* **5. Is the host on the network**
