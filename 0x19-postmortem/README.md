Postmortem: Database Connectivity Outage

Issue Summary
Duration: April 14, 2024, 10:30 AM - 12:00 PM UTC
Impact: The main web application experienced a complete outage. Users were unable to log in or access their dashboards. Approximately 90% of our user base was affected.
Root Cause: Misconfiguration in the database connection settings following a recent update.


Timeline
10:30 AM: Issue detected via automated monitoring alert indicating multiple failed database connection attempts.
10:32 AM: Engineers notified via Slack alert; initial investigation started.
10:40 AM: Assumption: Potential issue with the database server itself. Engineers began investigating database server logs.
11:00 AM: Misleading path: Investigation into server resource usage and network connectivity yielded no abnormalities.
11:15 AM: Escalated to the database administration team for deeper inspection.
11:25 AM: Root cause identified: Configuration file error caused by a recent update, leading to incorrect database connection parameters.
11:35 AM: Configuration file corrected and deployed.
11:45 AM: Database connections restored; system functionality verified.
12:00 PM: Full service restored and monitoring confirmed normal operation.

Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause
The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the database connection settings. During a recent system update, an incorrect database URL was introduced in the configuration file. This error caused the application to fail in establishing a connection to the database, resulting in a complete service outage.


Resolution
The issue was resolved by:

Identifying the incorrect database URL in the configuration file.
Correcting the database URL to the appropriate value.
Deploying the updated configuration file to the production environment.
Restarting the affected services to apply the changes.


Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements
Implement more rigorous testing and validation of configuration changes before deployment.
Enhance monitoring to include specific checks for database connectivity issues.

TODO List
Patch Configuration Management:
Implement automated validation scripts to check configuration files for errors before deployment.

Enhanced Monitoring:
Add monitoring for database connection metrics and alerts for anomalies.

Documentation:
Update documentation to include steps for validating database connection settings post-update.

Training:
Conduct a training session for engineers on common configuration pitfalls and how to avoid them.

Review Process:
Establish a peer review process for all configuration changes, ensuring that at least one other engineer reviews changes before they are applied.
